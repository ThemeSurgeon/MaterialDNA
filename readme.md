# MaterialDNA v 0.1

Welcome to the beginning of MaterialDNA! 
------------------------------------------
Note: The original body of work was forked from alexpatin, and the theme framework frontend is driven by Materialize.

MaterialDNA is a MaterialDNA theme, influenced heavily by Google's Material Design philosophy. Several front end styles have been adapted from the [Materialize](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize) front-end framework. 

MaterialDNA is in extreme infancy. The theme seeks to bridge the gap between traditional bootstrap themes, of which there are hundreds available, both free and premium, to the more standards based Google Material Design, which in my opinion is better across the board no matter the screen size. It is built from responsive mobile design out, meaning that it will always render correctly on small screens, and it will grow gracefully to the larger laptop and desktop screens.
